    The Siberian Husky’s compact body, well-furred coat, erect ears, and thick, sickle-shaped tail immediately suggest the

    breed’s northern heritage. The breed’s ancestors were originally bred in northeastern Asia by the Chukchi people and were

    kept as companion dogs for their families as well as endurance sled dogs.

    When changing climate conditions forced the semi-nomadic Chukchi to expand their hunting grounds or perish,

    they rose to the challenge by developing a sled dog capable of hauling light loads over vast expanses of frozen wasteland

    in sub-zero temperatures, with a minimum expenditure of energy. The Chukchi, isolated from the rest of the world, were able t

    o maintain the purity of their sled teams for many generations. The dogs they developed were the direct forerunners of

    today’s Siberian Husky.

    Siberians caught the eye of the public when they began winning sled races in the early 1900s, but they made headlines

    in 1925 when a legendary musher Leonhard Seppala led a relay of Siberian Huskies 658 miles in only five and a half days to

    rush a lifesaving serum to Nome, Alaska, where an epidemic of diphtheria had broken out. The thrilling “serum run,” reported

    breathlessly in newspapers around the world, won Siberians a popularity that has not abated to this day. Balto, who was

    Seppala’s lead dog on the final leg of the journey, remains one of the most honored hero dogs in canine history; a statue

    of him stands in New York City’s Central Park.

    Mushers still keep packs of sledding Siberians for fun and sport throughout North America. Less adventurous devotees of

    the breed simply enjoy the company of this sociable, gentle companion.
