The Alaskan Klee Kai have ancient geneology descending from the numerous native dogs which have made home to Alaska for thousands of

years. Many of these dogs have become not only loving family pets, but in the harsh environment of Alaska, were almost a necessity for

survival to the tribal and nomad peoples. These dogs excelled at pulling sleds, hiking, hunting, tracking, and were early

warning alerts for dangers such as wild animals or enemies approaching. One of the largest groups of native dogs that make up

the base of what became known as the Alaskan Husky type of dog are the Alaskan Interior Village dogs. Husky lines from Siberia,

which were imported to Alaska in the early 1900s, were added to much of this hearty dog population as dog sled racing started to

grow. They developed an intelligent, vigorous, and hardworking dog, with a happy nature.

The Alaskan Klee Kai breed we see today was developed in Alaska from these well-bred husky dogs by Linda Spurlin and her family

starting in the early 1970s. Using a strict breeding program to select the somewhat smaller dogs with the type/look she

envisioned that also met her high standards for health, structure and temperament, she carefully developed a companion-sized

version of the Alaska Husky with a very distinctive contrasting symmetrical facial mask and markings. Like their ancestors,

the Alaskan Klee Kai is adaptable to multiple lifestyles, traveling, hiking, entertainment, therapy and service, and

most importantly, a loving companion dog for all ages. If your looking for a great, small, companion to make your family happy.

Summit Farms recommends the Klee Kai.
